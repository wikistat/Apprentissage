    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1 General objective\n",
    "The objective is to recognize the activity of an individual carrying a smartphone that records a set of signals from the onboard gyroscope and accelerometer and thus connected. A learning database has been built experimentally. A set of wearers of a smartphone produced a determined activity during a predefined period of time while signals were recorded. The data are from the human activity recognition (HAR) community. See the [article](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/Proceedings/esann/esannpdf/es2013-11.pdf) reporting on a 2013 conference.  Data analysis associated with real-time activity identification is not addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available public data were acquired, described and partially analyzed by [Anguita et al. (2013)](https://www.icephd.org/sites/default/files/IWAAL2012.pdf). They are accessible on the [repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) at the University California Irvine (UCI) dedicated to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archive contains the raw data: accelerations sampled at 64 htz for 2s. The accelerations in x, y, and z, each of 128 columns, those in y subtracting the natural gravity as well as the angular accelerations (gyroscope) in x, y, and z, that is to say 9 files in all. The choice of a power of 2 for the sampling frequency allows the efficient execution of Fourier transform or wavelet algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Process\n",
    "A first visualization and exploration of the raw signals shows (section 2) that they are difficult to analyze; the activity classes are indeed poorly characterized. The main cause is the lack of synchronization of the activity beginnings; the phase shift of the signals then appears as a noise or artifact very detrimental for a good discrimination of the activities on the basis of a usual Euclidean distance ($L_2$). This is the reason why [Anguita et al. (2013)](https://www.icephd.org/sites/default/files/IWAAL2012.pdf) propose to compute a set of classical transformations or features (*features*) of signal processing: variance, correlations, entropy, Fourier decompositions... These are then $p=561$ variables which are considered and explored in section 3. The [principal component analysis](http://wikistat.fr/pdf/st-m-explo-acp.pdf) and especially the [discriminant factor analysis](http://wikistat.fr/pdf/st-m-explo-acp.pdf) show the good discriminatory qualities of these feature data resulting from an expert knowledge of the signals. Section 4 exploits these features  and shows that elementary statistical models (logistic regression, discriminant analysis) or a classical support vector machine (SVM) algorithm using a simple linear kernel lead to excellent predictions in contrast to sophisticated non-linear algorithms (*random forest*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, having sophisticated transformations computed all the time is not a viable solution for the battery of a connected embedded object. The candidate algorithm must be able to produce a solution that can be integrated (wired) into a circuit, as is the case, for example, with chips dedicated to facial recognition. This is the purpose of section 5: to show the feasibility of a solution based on raw signals only; solution using neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Software environment\n",
    "To be executed, this notebook (*jupyter notebook*) requires the installation of Python 3 via for example the site [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html). The exploration and statistical learning algorithms used are available in the [`Scikit-learn`] library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). \n",

    "\n",
    "Each record or statistical unit or instance is labeled with **6 activities**: standing, sitting, lying, walking, climbing or descending stairs. Each dataset is split into a training sample and a test sample. The test sample is only used to evaluate and compare the predictive qualities of the main methods. It is kept as it is in order to make comparisons  with the results of the literature. It is a *supervised classification* problem (6 classes) with $n=10299$ samples for learning, 2947 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains two sets of different dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multidimensional set: an individual consists of 9 Time Series of *dimensions* $(n, 128, 9)$.\n",
    "2. One-dimensional set: The 9 Time Series are concatenated to constitute a vector of 128*9 = 1152 variables of *dimensions* $(n, 1152)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*N.B.* The data structure is significantly more complex than those commonly studied in the [Wikistat repository](https://github.com/wikistat/). The code has been structured in a sequence of functions in order to facilitate understanding. The *notebook* tool reaches its limits here for the realization of complex codes.\n",

    "### 4.1 [Logistic regression](http://wikistat.fr/pdf/st-m-app-rlogit.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle\n",
    "An old statistical method but finally efficient on these data. Logistic regression is adapted to the prediction of a binary variable. In the multiclass case, the logistic function of the `Scikit-learn` library estimates *by default* **a model by class**: one class against the others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an individual belonging to a class is modeled using a linear combination of the explanatory variables. To transform a linear combination with value in $\\mathbb{R}$ into a probability with value in the interval $[0, 1]$, a sigmoidal function is applied.  This gives: $$P(y_i=1)=\\frac{e^{Xb}}{1+e^{Xb}}$$ or, equivalently, a linear decomposition of the *logit* or *log odd ratio* of $P(y_i=1)$: $$\\log\\frac{P(y_i=1)}{1-P(y_i=1)}=Xb.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimation of the model without optimization\n",
    "The model is estimated without trying to refine the values of some parameters (penalization). This will be done in a second step. The parameter of choice of the *solver* is specified because the default choice (`lbfgs`) seems to converge less quickly. A systematic comparison of the different options (`liblinear, lbfgs, saga, sag, newton-cg`) would be welcome in association with the choice of the model when the number of classes is greater than 2 : multinomial loss function or a binomial model per class.\n"
